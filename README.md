By Prateik Sinha, Melina Diaz, and Anvesha Dutta for a DataRes Research project to research neural network applications in graphs.

- `data` is Wikipedia articles including their links to each other, categories, and entire text of each article.
- `original_importing.ipynb` imports `data` into Neo4j


**We performed deep learning and natural language processing on Wikipedia articles to classify articles by category and identify keywords. This allowed us to compare the effectiveness of classfication by links vs. by content, and understand GCN and GNN.**
